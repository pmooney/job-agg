Chocolate chip cookies fresh out of the oven, for instance. Or, for that matter, semi-stale cookies out of the bag. Turns out we\u2019re less picky about our biscuit choices, but one thing is for sure: a good recipe is the difference between a ho-hum snack and a melt-in-your-mouth chocolate extravaganza. We can\u2019t share the family cookie recipe (Mum would kill us) but we CAN share our latest client\u2019s recipe for success.\rAs an online tech publication with over 40 million readers around the world, they know a thing or two about keeping it fresh. Always on the cutting edge, their writers discourse on software, hardware, space, cloud services, culture, and electronics. Basically, they\u2019re experts on all the cool stuff you want to know about, so why not join them? They might even throw in a few complimentary snacks.\rWhile the client operates out of a London office, you also have the option to work remotely. Just think: in between managing their software projects from beginning to end, you could have your own tray of treats baking in the oven. A midday snack sounds like a great way to stay on task, which will be important because this small team only has room for self-starters who work solo as well as they work in a group.\rSo, besides baking up a storm, what will you be doing? Working as a Perl developer, you\u2019ll be responsible for consultation, design, development, testing, and deployment. While the snacks cool, you\u2019ll primarily use back-end Perl code on Debian servers with a smattering of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript thrown in for flavour.\rGot your mouth watering? If so, shoot us an email and let us know; there might just be a biscuit in it for you.", "Desired skills:": "Strong Perl is a must\r\n    DBIx::Class experience\r\n    Basic front-end skills / not scared of small amounts of JavaScript, HTML\r\n    Very comfortable on Linux, ideally Debian", "Website for more information:": "", "Contact information:": "pete@perl.careers"}
